# Traditional Puerto Rican Coquito

Todd learned about this on NPR about 25 years ago and has been making it
at Christmas ever since.

## About Coquito

Coquito, often called "Puerto Rican eggnog," is a cherished holiday
tradition that embodies the warmth and spirit of Puerto Rican culture.
This creamy, coconut-based beverage has been passed down through
generations, with each family adding their own special touch to the
recipe.

Originating in Puerto Rico, coquito is much more than just a
drink---it's a symbol of family, celebration, and togetherness. During
the Christmas season, Puerto Rican families gather to prepare large
batches of coquito, often making it a communal activity where recipes
and stories are shared. The tradition of gifting bottles of homemade
coquito to friends, neighbors, and loved ones strengthens community
bonds and spreads holiday joy throughout the island and beyond.

**Ingredients:**

Cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, white rum
(Bacardi), coconut rum (Malibu), vanilla extract, and cinnamon

The blend of tropical coconut flavors with warm spices creates a taste
that transports you to the island's festive spirit, making every sip a
celebration of Puerto Rican heritage and the joy of sharing special
moments with those we love.
